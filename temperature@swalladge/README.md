## About

This simply displays the current temperature from a server running
[rpi-temperature-server](https://github.com/swalladge/rpi-temperature-server).
It was developed as an example of how the server could be used.

The temperature server in question was developed for a uni project in 2016
involving web development, a Raspberry Pi, and a temperature sensor - more info
can be found on its [project
page](https://github.com/swalladge/rpi-temperature-server).
